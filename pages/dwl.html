<p>My first rather serious linux system should be built on a Thinkpad x61s in 2023. Due to a lack in performence I thought about installing only the most minimal software on it.</p>

<p>So I came to see the famouse Thinkpad Arch combination. (I know and knew that it was not the most minimal os possible, but I was convinced) When trying to find the most minimal and fast window manager found the perfect fit: <code>dwm</code>.</p>

<p><code>dwm</code> became my wm that just worked.</p>

<hr />

<p>However as I continued to gain understanding of how Xorg works and as I understood the bloat in the <code>X Window System </code>, I found it hard to swich. 

On YouTube I came across <code>dwl</code> a project about translating <code>dwl</code> to work with <code>wlroots</code>.</p>

<p>Even though being familiar with the rather difficult to install <code>dwm</code>, I wasnâ€™t able to even compile <code>dwl</code>. Now I understand and give you - the reader - a path to follow.</p>
