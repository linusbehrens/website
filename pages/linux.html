<h1 id="why-gnulinux">Why GNU/Linux</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do
it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text
streams, because that is a univeRsal interface</p>
<p><em>- Doug McIlroy, the inventor of Unix pipes and one of the
founders of the Unix tradition</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linux at its core is the idea of intercompatability born in the body
of a kernel. What I love in Linux is not how fast and free it is. Not
how amazingly many people contribute to one goal. It is the way I use it
and how it allowed me to fit the most bare bones software to my
needs.</p>
<h2 id="examples-for-the-perfect-fit">Examples for the perfect fit</h2>
<p>My senior high note taking setup is pretty complex. However it does
fit my workflow perfectly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/neovim">neovim</a> note taking</li>
<li><a href="posts/tex"></a> for long-term sheets</li>
<li><a href="posts/markdown">markdown</a> for short-term notes in
lessons</li>
<li>pandoc turns markdown into <code>\tex</code></li>
<li>telescope and todo-comments for todo lists</li>
<li><a href="posts/anki">anki</a> for everyday learning</li>
<li>github for backing up and syncing my data (homelab in the
future)</li>
</ul>
<p>With that setup I am albe to quickly make notes in my lessons as well
as clearly structure my long-term sheets. With having anki on any of my
devices I am able to learn everywhere.</p>
<p>If I want I could even run all of that over ssh from a homelab of
server at school.</p>
<h2 id="intercompatability">Intercompatability</h2>
<p>My shell runs in <a
href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">alacritty</a> (macOS) and
<a href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a> (arch and void). My most used
and centered tool is <a href="/posts/neovim">neovim</a>. With my
configuration it is beautiful and works seemlesly. With telescope I
quickly open my <code>&lt;subject&gt;.refile.md</code> note and later
the week I convert it to <code>&lt;subject.refile.tex</code> with
pandoc. The important information gets refiled into
<code>&lt;subject&gt;.tex</code> and tagged as
<code>ANKI: &lt;subject&gt;</code>. So if I open telescope to see my
todos the anki sign reminds me of entering the information to my
<code>anki deck</code>. Every evening I push my files to github to be
safe for a data loss.</p>
<h2 id="options-example-distributions">Options (example
distributions)</h2>
<p>The following are distros I have used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manjaro (Why does it exists exactly)</li>
<li>Mint (If you would want to cheat)</li>
<li><a href="/content/arch.md">Arch</a> (Amazing documentation, pacman,
AUR)</li>
<li>Arco (No systemd arch)</li>
<li>Gentoo (If you want it you know it)</li>
<li>Void (small, but no systemd!)</li>
</ul>
<p>On my <strong>x61s ThinkPad</strong> I run Arch Linux. It is light
weight and has amazing documentary. The arch wiki is one of the best
documents and I even refer to it to non specific arch users.</p>
<p>The <strong>2013 Mac mini</strong> runs void linux. Not because I
don’t like arch as much, but because after inserting a bootable usb and
entering grubs “install arch for x86_64” I got a black screen for days.
I choose void because I liked the neofetch batch and because it has no
<code>systemd</code> elevating the performence and reducing drama. I
mainly use that mashine as a ssh server.</p>
<p>Both mashines run <a href="https://www.suckless.org">suckless
software</a>. Namely <code>dwm</code>, <code>dmenu</code>, and
<code>st</code>. I am really happy with how good it works, but I do not
feel well using <code>X</code>.</p>
<p>My <strong>MacBook</strong> runs macOS because Asahi sucks at the
moment. However I use the tiling window manager <code>yabaii</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">alacritty</a> to come
closer to a linux experience.</p>
