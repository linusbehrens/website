When ever editing big text projects I used $\LaTeX$. Just because Latex is the right tool for the job.

But as it turned out there has been a simpler tool for the job. And it is called Typst.

Why it is simpler:

- It is FOSS
- Ready to write: no `\document{begin}`
- Markdown based syntax where it can: eg. headings with `=`
- Easy math syntax
- Simple coding constructs instead of single use case based macros
- FOSS templates ready to clone
- Renders preview from buffer: instant update without having to safe

```typ
lim_(x->oo) 1/x = 0
```
